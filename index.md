### CPSC 120

* Lab 4
    I like this lab ( both part 1 and 2) because it was the first assignment that I "perfectly completed". Since I had issue to rent an empty laptop for the first 3 weeks in this semester, I could not finish the previous assignments and I got 0s on the assignments. I did try to get help from my instructors, but they did not really help me. I could rent an empty laptop for Linux on the 4th week, and I completed this assignment.

Lab 5
    I want to mention the part-3 of this assignment. I can't say this is my favorite, but it is very meaningful for me. My partner had some personal reason he could not work on this assignment together after the lab class. Since he was a very nice guy, I decided to complete this part by myself rather than doing it right before the due date with him. However, even though I spent 8 hours to complete this assignment, I failed and I lost my interest on computer science. I realized that coding is very boring and difficult, I decided to change my major. Since this lab was the motivation of my big decision, this lab is very meaningful for me.

Lab 7
    I like the part 2 of this assignment. Even though I lost passion about computer science, this lab was interesting. Writing functions and equations, setting different outputs according to the input that changes depending on what users put. This lab the most interesting lab I have done during the semester. Also I want to mention my partner at the time, he was such a very good guy as a partnet and friend.
